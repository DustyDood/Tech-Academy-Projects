                <h3>Hello!</h3>
                <p>My name is Justin "Dusty" Zoland. I graduated cum laude from UCLA in 3 years. I achieved a BA in Psychology, but I've worked in a variety of fields since, including HR, payroll, and data analysis.</p>
                <p>During the pandemic, I realized I always had a passion for coding. I realized I needed to step out of my comfort zone, which led me to the Tech Academy. The rest is history! </p>
                <p>Ultimately, I want to start a video game studio after I've refined my developing skills. </p>
