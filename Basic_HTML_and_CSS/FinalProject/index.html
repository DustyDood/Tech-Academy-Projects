                    <h3>Hello!</h3>
                    <p>My name is Justin "Dusty" Zoland. I graduated cum laude from UCLA in 3 years. I achieved a BA in Psychology, but I've worked in a variety of fields since, including HR, payroll, and data analysis.</p>
                    <p>During the pandemic, I realized I always had a passion for coding. I decided I needed to step out of my comfort zone, which led me to the Tech Academy. The rest is history! </p>
                    <p>Ultimately, I want to start a video game studio with my family and friends that creates games to make a difference. </p>
