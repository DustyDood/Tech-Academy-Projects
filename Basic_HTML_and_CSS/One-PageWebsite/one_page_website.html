      <div id="EightiesMusic">
        <h3>80's Music</h3>
        <iframe width="75%" height="409" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vzyn60Zns-E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>In the mood for something a little more old school? How about Genesis!</p>
        <p>Even though there's a variety of catchy options, my personal favorite is "That's All", which you can listen to above!</p>
      </div>

      <div id="Kpop">
        <h3>K-pop Music</h3>
        <iframe width="75%" height="409" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckIGhwQtd-c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Need something a little bit more upbeat and energetic? K-pop is perfect for you!</p>
        <p>With a group like BEAST, everything makes you want to get up to move! Of course, this may be counterproductive to studying, but moving around is a good refresher!</p>
      </div>

      <div id="VG">
        <h3>Video Game Music</h3>
        <p>Hopefully you're open to video game music because there is some great stuff out there.</p>
        <p>In fact, we're even going to give you three options!</p>

        <h5>Chrono Trigger</h5>
        <iframe width="75%" height="409" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkpxi-x0AFo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>A renowned hit, Chrono Trigger's music was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda for the SNES, a 16 bit machine.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the music truly evokes a sense of nostalgia and calm, regardless of the hardware's original limitation.</p>

        <h5>The World Ends With You</h5>
        <iframe width="75%" height="409" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4V9-vEspL-k?list=PLp_6nrGNo8_nhQ7XzOCYl0-3x2mHY7JSl" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>The World Ends With You was a game that flew under the radar for most folks, but it's a hit that shouldn't be missed.</p>
        <p>The soundtrack has a bit more variety, having songs that provoke calm to accelerating anxiety. This intentional diversity represents Shibuya's diversity of cultures and ideas, a key theme and location for the game.</p>

        <h5>NieR Automata</h5>
        <iframe width="727" height="409" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_dCwFxoy7M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>A more modern video game, NieR automata's soundtrack is heavily inspired by classical music.</p>
        <p>The overall theme of the music is somber, but it is something that should be listened to at least once.</p>
